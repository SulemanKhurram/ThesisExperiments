# Bayesian CNN

Implementation of [Bayes by Backprop](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05424) in a convolutional neural network.

### One convolutional layer with distributions over weights in each filter

### Fully Bayesian perspective of an entire CNN 

![Distributions must be over weights in convolutional layers and weights in fully-connected layers.](figures/CNNwithdist_git.png)

### Results 
#### Results on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with 3Conv3FC
